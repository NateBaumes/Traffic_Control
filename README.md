Efficiently finding the shortest paths in large road networks is crucial for modern navigation systems. Sequential algorithms struggle with real-time computation on complex networks. By implementing both sequential and parallel versions of Dijkstra's algorithm, this project explores how parallel processing can speed up route calculations, improving navigation systems for real-world traffic scenarios.
